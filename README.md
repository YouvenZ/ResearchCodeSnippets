# 🔬 ResearchKit Python Snippets

> *A curated collection of Python tools for researchers — from idea to publication, one snippet at a time.*

## What is this?

This repo is a personal toolkit of small, focused Python scripts built to remove friction from the research workflow. Each file does one thing well: summarize a paper, format a citation, generate a hypothesis, visualize results, or turn a notebook into a draft article. No bloated frameworks, no complex setup — just grab what you need and run it.

Whether you're writing your first paper or your fiftieth, something here will save you time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Most scripts are self-contained. Clone the repo and install the common dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/researchkit-snippets
cd researchkit-snippets
pip install langchain ollama arxiv pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn
```

Then run any script directly:

```bash
python abstract_generator.py
python paper_reviewer.py
python doi_to_bib.py
```

Each file has a usage example at the bottom under `# Usage` — just open it and run.

## 🧩 A Typical Workflow

Here's how these scripts fit together in practice:

```
1. Search & fetch papers     →  quick_search.py, arxiv_batch.py
2. Read & summarize          →  abstract_summary.py, paper_qa.py
3. Find gaps & ideas         →  gap_finder.py, hypothesis_gen.py
4. Run experiments           →  sig_tester.py, compare_models.py
5. Create figures            →  pub_plots.py, conf_matrix.py
6. Format for publication    →  df_to_latex_pro.py, bib_formatter.py
7. Draft & review            →  writing_team.py, paper_reviewer.py
```

## 🛠️ Design Philosophy

These scripts are intentionally small and direct. Each one:

- **Does one thing** — no god-classes or over-engineered abstractions
- **Shows its work** — every file has a usage example at the bottom
- **Uses local models where possible** — privacy-friendly, works offline via Ollama
- **Is easy to modify** — under 150 lines, readable by a human in 5 minutes

| `matplotlib` / `seaborn` | Visualization scripts |
| `scipy` / `sklearn` | Statistics and ML scripts |
